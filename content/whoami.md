Welcome to my blog, I'm BA-Seven (or simply Seven), a french newbie h4x0r, to serve you. 

To sum up my infosec skills, I'm bad at pwn and barely decent in web (notice how I don't even talk about crypto).

Sharing here some of the things I found interesting through my journey.

Member of the Subuthax team 🇫🇷 and active on root-me.org.

Don't hesitate to reach my or Discord or whatever if you liked this blog :)
